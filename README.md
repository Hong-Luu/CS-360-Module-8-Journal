# CS 360 Module 8 Journal

**Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**.
The app I developed aimed to address the user's need for efficient inventory management. It allowed users to log in, view, add, update, and delete items in their inventory. Additionally, the app provided SMS notifications for low inventory levels, enhancing inventory monitoring and management.

**What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**
To support user needs and create a user-centered UI, the app required screens for login, inventory display, item addition, and SMS notification settings. The UI designs prioritized simplicity, intuitive navigation, and clear visual cues. For example, login screens were designed with easily recognizable input fields, while inventory screens presented items in a grid format for easy browsing.

**How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?**
During the coding process, I followed a structured approach, breaking down tasks into manageable units and utilizing modular programming techniques. I also employed consistent naming conventions and added inline comments for clarity. These strategies can be applied in the future to streamline development and enhance code readability.

**How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?**
Testing was crucial to ensure functional code. I conducted extensive testing using the Android Emulator to simulate various user interactions and scenarios. This process revealed any bugs or errors in the code, allowing me to address them promptly. Testing is important as it helps identify and rectify issues before the app is deployed, ensuring a smooth user experience.

**Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**
Innovation was necessary during the database design phase to accommodate dynamic user data input and retrieval. Implementing robust database management functionalities required innovative approaches to ensure seamless data handling and storage.

**In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**
I demonstrated my knowledge and skills in database management, user authentication, and UI design. These components were critical for the app's functionality and user experience. By effectively implementing these aspects, I showcased my proficiency in mobile app development and problem-solving.
